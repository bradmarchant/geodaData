#' Chile Functional Labour Market Areas
#'
#' A set of recently created labour market areas (LMAs) for Chile, required to analyze spatial labour market activity and provide a framework to guide spatially-explicit employment policy development. The data set includes 62 LMAs, providing full coverage of the Chilean territory, delineated based on optimisation requirements of self-containment, cohesion and homogeneity of a regionalisation algorithm described in Casado-DÃ­az et al. (2017), using commuting data from the CHilean Migration (CHIM) database (Rowe & Bell, 2013). Data from the 1982, 1992 and 2002 Chilean Housing and Population census were appended to the set of LMAs to produce a geographic information database. The database contains information on the resident population by five-year age groups, sex, labour force status, industry sector and occupation.
